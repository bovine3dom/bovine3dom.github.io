# Hi!

I'm a Postgraduate Researcher at the University of Manchester working with complex networks. My supervisor, Dr Eva Navarro-LÃ³pez[^Eva], and I are investigating the robustness of complex networks.

{{< figure class="blog-image" src="/images/me.jpg" title="This is me." >}}

I generally programme in Python and Julia[^Julia].

I am at the School of Computer Science Centre for Doctoral Training. I previously studied Theoretical Physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy, also at the University of Manchester. As part of that degree I worked with Ksenia Grozdova under Sue Astley on a project on measuring mammographic density using computer vision techniques.

<!-- that tells Hugo where to cut things off -->

<!-- I am particularly interested in how complex networks change over time, and ways of meassuring those changes. My supervisor is Eva Navarro-Lopez. --> 

You can view my GitHub repository at https://github.com/bovine3dom where you will find a small project I wrote for a C++ class, and the code for the mammographic density estimation; most importantly, my dotfiles.

This is some Julia:

```
for i in 1:10
    do_science(i)
end
```
